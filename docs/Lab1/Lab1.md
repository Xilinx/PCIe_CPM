# Lab 1: QDMA AXI MM Interface to NoC and DDR Lab

This lab describes the process of generating a AMD Versal&trade; adaptive SoC QDMA design with AXI4 Memory Mapped interface connected to network on chip (NoC) IP and DDR memory. This design has the following configurations:
* AXI4 memory mapped (AXI MM) connected to DDR through the NoC IP
* Gen3 x 16
* MSI-X interrupts

This lab provides step by step instructions to configure a Control, Interfaces and Processing System (CIPS) QDMA design and network on chip (NoC) IP. The following figure shows the AXI4 Memory Mapped (AXI-MM) interface to DDR using the NoC IP. At the end of this lab, you can synthesize and implement the design, and generate a Programmable Device Image (PDI) file. The PDI file is used to program the AMD Versal adaptive SoC and run data traffic on a system. For the AXI-MM interface host to chip (H2C) transfers, data is read from Host andsent to DDR memory. For chip to host (C2H) transfers, data is read from DDR memory and written to host.

This lab targets a xcvc1902-vsvd1760-1LP-e-S-es1 part on a VCK5000 board. This lab connects to DDR memory found outside the adaptive SoC.

## Set the PCIe Reset Pin

Because the Board option is selected, there is no need to select a pin for PCIe Reset. However, if the Evaluation Board option is not selected, and the user application has a AMD Versal adaptive SoC part, then the PCIe. Reset pin must be set correctly. Follow the steps below to set the PCIe Reset pin.

1. In the CIPS PS CPM Configuration page, select **PS-PMC**, and click **IO Configuration**.

    The IO Configuration page displays with a list of options to configure the CPM-PCIe functional mode.
2. In the Peripheral column, select the **PCIe Reset**.

    Notice that CPM PCIE Controller 0 (End Point) by default is set to the **PS MIO 18** pin.

3. Select the MIO pin based on your design for the PCIe reset connection.

   The available MIO pin selections are PS MIO 18, PMC MIO 24, and PMC MIO 38.
