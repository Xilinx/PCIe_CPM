# Lab 4: XDMA AXI MM Interface to NoC and DDR Lab

This lab describes the process of generating a AMD Versal&trade; adaptive SoC XDMA design with AXI4 Memory Mapped interface connecting to DDR memory. This lab explains a step by step procedure to configure a Control, Interfaces and Processing System (CIPS) XDMA design and network on chip (NoC) IP. The following figure shows the AXI4 Memory Mapped (AXI-MM) interface to DDR using the NoC IP. At the end of this lab, you can synthesize and implement the design, and generate a Programmable Device Image (PDI) file. The PDI file is used to program the AMD Versal adaptive SoC and run data traffic on a system. For host to chip (H2C) transfers, data is read from Host, and sent to DDR memory. For chip to host (C2H) transfers, data is read from DDR memory and written to Host. Transfer can be initiated on all 4 channels.

This lab targets a VCK190 Evaluation board. This lab connects to DDR found outside the AMD Versal adaptive SoC.

7. Click **OK**. An empty block design diagram canvas opens.

## Instantiate the CIPS IP

1. Right-click on the block design canvas, and select **Add IP**.
2. The IP catalog pops up. In the Search field type CIPS to filter to the list of IP.

    ![](./media/image5.png)
3. From the filtered list, double-click the **Control, Interface, and Processing System** IP core to instantiate the IP on the block design canvas.
4. This adds the AMD Versal adaptive SoC CIPS IP to the canvas. Double-click the **Versal CIPS IP**.

## Set the PCIe Reset Pin

Because the Board option is selected, there is no need to select a pin for PCIe Reset. However, if the Evaluation Board option is not selected, and the user application has a AMD Versal adaptive SoC part, then the PCIe Reset pin must be set correctly. Follow the steps below to set the PCIe Reset pin.

1. In the CIPS PS CPM Configuration page, select **PS-PMC**, and click **IO Configuration**.

    The IO Configuration page displays with a list of options to configure the CPM-PCIe functional mode.

2. In the Peripheral column, select the **PCIe Reset** checkbox. 

    Notice that only A0 End Point is selectable in the I/O column.

    Notice also that the multi-use I/O (MIO) pin selected in PCIe reset is automatically connected to the PCIe Reset I/O, in this case MIO 38.

3. Next to A0 End Point, select **PS MIO 38**, which is the MIO pin that matches the MIO pin is connected in your board.

    Available MIO pin selections are PS MIO 18, PMC MIO 24, and PMC MIO 38.

    -   Number of AXI Slave Interfaces: **2**.
    -   Number of AXI Master Interfaces: **0**.
    -   Number of AXI Clocks: **2**.

    The number of AXI clocks is set to two because there are two clocks needed for the AXI Slave input, and none needed for AXI Master output.
    -   Memory Controller: **Single Memory Controller**.
    -   Number of Memory Controller Port: **4**.
    -   All others options use the default settings.
